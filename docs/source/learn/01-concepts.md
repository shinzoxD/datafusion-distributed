# Concepts

This library is a collection of DataFusion extensions that enable distributed
query execution. You can think of it as normal DataFusion, with the addition
that some nodes are capable of streaming data over the network using Arrow
Flight instead of through in-memory communication.

Key terminology:

- `Stage`: a portion of the plan separated by a network boundary from other
  parts of the plan. A plan contains one or more stages, each separated by
  network boundaries.
- `Task`: a unit of work in a stage that executes a plan in parallel to other
  tasks within the stage. Each task in a stage runs on a different worker its
  own plan variant — pre-specialized at planning time for the subset of data it
  is responsible for.
- `Network Boundary`: a node in the plan that streams data from a network
  interface rather than directly from its children nodes.
- `Worker`: a physical machine listening to serialized execution plans over an
  Arrow Flight interface. A task is executed by exactly one worker, but one
  worker executes many tasks concurrently.
- `Leaf stage`: a bottom stage of the plan — one that reads source data (e.g. a
  `DataSourceExec`).
- `Head stage`: the top stage, executed on a single task by the coordinator. Its
  output is what the client sees.

You'll see these concepts mentioned extensively across the documentation and the
code itself. Scans may also print `predicate=DynamicFilter [ empty ]`; that is
a DataFusion runtime filter, not a distributed-planning node. See
[How Dynamic Filtering Works](04-how-dynamic-filtering-works.md).

# Public API

Some other more tangible concepts are the structs and traits exposed publicly,
the most important are:

## [SessionStateBuilderExt](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-distributed/blob/main/src/distributed_planner/session_state_builder_ext.rs)

An extension trait for `SessionStateBuilder` that provides
`with_distributed_planner()`. This registers a custom query planner that
transforms single-node DataFusion query plans into distributed query plans after
physical planning.

It builds the distributed plan from bottom to top, injecting network boundaries
at appropriate locations based on the nodes present in the original plan.

## [Worker](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-distributed/blob/main/src/worker/worker_service.rs)

gRPC server implementation that integrates with the Tonic ecosystem and listens
to serialized plans that get executed over the wire.

Users are expected to build these and spawn them in ports so that the network
boundary nodes can reach them.

## [WorkerResolver](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-distributed/blob/main/src/worker_resolver.rs)

Determines the available workers in the Distributed DataFusion cluster by
returning their URLs.

Different organizations have different networking requirements—from Kubernetes
deployments to cloud provider solutions. This trait allows Distributed
DataFusion to adapt to various scenarios.

## [Planner event handlers](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-distributed/tree/main/src/events)

Event handlers let applications participate in distinct distributed-planning lifecycle phases:
`DesiredTaskCountHandler` supplies task-count hints, `ScaleUpLeafNodeHandler`
specializes leaves after the final count is known, and `RouteTasksHandler` assigns
task slots to workers.

The number of tasks each stage has is determined from bottom to top. This means
that leaf stages will decide how many tasks they need to execute based on the
amount of data their leaf nodes will pull. Upper stages will have their number
of tasks reduced or increased depending on how much the cardinality of the data
was reduced in previous stages.

## [DistributedTaskContext](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-distributed/blob/main/src/stage.rs)

An extension present during the `ExecutionPlan::execute()` that contains
information about the current task in which the plan is being executed.

For built-in file-based plans (`DataSourceExec`), data partitioning is handled
automatically at planning time via `DistributedLeafExec`: each task receives a
pre-built plan variant with its own isolated file groups, so no runtime dispatch
is needed.

For custom leaf nodes that need to dispatch work themselves,
`DistributedTaskContext` exposes `task_index` and `task_count` so execution
logic can select the appropriate data subset. For example, task 0 of 3 might
return the first third of rows, task 2 the last third, and so on. See
[Distribute a custom `ExecutionPlan`](../user-guide/04-distribute-custom-plan.md)
for guidance on which approach to use.

## [ChannelResolver](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-distributed/blob/main/src/protocol/channel_resolver.rs)

Optional extension trait that allows to customize how connections are
established to workers. Given one of the URLs returned by the `WorkerResolver`,
it builds an Arrow Flight client ready for serving queries.
